# core

As in 1990's, dBase had let many people become highly productive programmers, by its simple working environment and strong data operability.

We're aiming similar goals to create a framework for building microservices, that is
* reliable - based on .NetCore and PostgresSQL
* lightweight while battery-included - live fine without thridparties such as Radis or Kafka
* high-performance, esp on multi-core boxes
* data handling and operation are unified and direct
* much less coding - a couple of guys may cope with large applications
