As in 1990's, dBase had let many people become highly productive programmers, by its simple working environment and strong data operability.

We're aiming similar goals to create a framework that we can handle and operate on data with much less code, so that a couple of guys may cope with large clustered applications 

quickly build and deploy services
support single or multiple service instances per host
support multiple instances of same service (load balance)
automatic registration and discovery of service instances
monitor the behavior of each service instance
easy interoperability with other programming languages
